# Web-Assessment

What did you like about this project?
I think its challenging, it allows me to know which level I am at with coding. 
I think this is a good practice and enables me to recap and apply what I have learn. 
It also makes me more resourceful and search the internet to solve my problems, and when the issue is solved, 
there is a sense of enjoyment and fulfillment.


What did you struggle with in this project?
I would like to say everything as its my first time doing this with out Jean's guidance. 
It was tough but slowly I get the hang of playing around with the methods to get the result.
I hope I dont fail this assessment!

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
More time! I know we have been given alot of time already but still I find myself racing through it.
